# Secure-Hash-Fusion-A-Compact-LLM-Based-Design
This project implements the RTL design and verification of the SHA-1 hash algorithm in SystemVerilog using OSS CAD tools, validated through testbench simulation and a Python reference model, with an extensible interface supporting both SHA-1 and SHA-256 for cryptographic hardware verification.
